# java_practice_repo_solo
gonna try some java on my local machine, never even gave it a shot but seeing how its important at Rogers and how they use it on everything, might help me move up.

Java is mainly used on the backend, android dev, enterprise software, etc.. 
the goal is to get this, python, terraform iac and node.js as my go to programming languages. 

Classes are a blueprint to create objects. Objects are instances of classes. An example of what this all means; classes are like a blueprint designed by an architect for building a house, defining the little details and stuff of that nature. Houses are the objects. 
there are 2 types of class content;
data (also known as variables, properties and constants)
and
Actions (methods, functions)
